It seems not improbable that this may be the same person with the preceding, but we have no evidence by which to decide the fact, and the name of Hannibal appears to have been so common at Carthage, that it can by no means be assumed. Hannibal had a considerable army under his command, yet he did not venture to face the Romans in the field, and shut himself up within the walls of Agrigentum. The Roman consuls, L. Postumius Megellus and Q. Mamilius Vitulus, established their armies in two separate fortified camps, which they united by lines of intrenchment, and thus proceeded to blockade the city. Hannibal was soon reduced to great distress, for want of provisions, but held out, in hopes of being relieved by Hanno, who had advanced as far as Heraclea to his support. [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">HANNO</hi>, No 8.] But the operations of the latter were unsuccessful, and when he at length ventured on a decisive effort, He was completely defeated. Hereupon Hannibal, who had himself made an unsuccessful attack upon the Roman camp, during their engagement with Hanno, determined to abandon the town, and succeeded, under cover of the night, in forcing his way through the enemy's lines, and making good his retreat with what troops remained to him in safety to Panormus. Agrigentum itself was immediately afterwards stormed and piundered by the Romans.

Hannibal's attention was henceforth directed principally to carrying on the contest by sea : with a fleet of sixty ships, he ravaged the coasts of Italy, which were then almost defenceless; and the next year (<date when-custom=\"-260\">B. C. 260</date>), on learning that the consul, Cn. Cornelius Scipio Asina, had put to sea with a squadron of seventeen ships, he dispatched Boodes, with twenty gullies, to meet him at Lipara, where the latter succeeded by a stratagem in capturing Scipio, with his whole squadron. After this success, Hannibal put to sea in person, with fifty ships, for the purpose of again ravaging the coasts of Italy, but, falling in unexpectedly with the whole Roman fleet, lie lost many of his ships, and with difficulty made his escape to Sicily with the remainder. Here, however, he joined the rest of his fleet, and C. Duilius, having taken the command of that of the Romans, almost immediately brought on a general action off Mylae. Hannibal, well knowing the inexperience land want of skill of the Romans in naval warfare, and having apparently a superior force, had anticipated an easy victory, but the valour of the Romans, together with the strange contrivance of the <hi rend=\"ital\">corvi,</hi> or boarding bridges, gained them the advantage; the Carthaginians were totally defeated, and not less than fifty of their ships sunk, destroyed, or taken. Hannibal himself was obliged to abandon his own ship (a vessel of seven banks of oars, which had formerly belonged to Pyrrhus), and make his escape in a small boat. He hastened to Carthage, where, it is said, he contrived by an ingenious stratagem to escape the punishlment so often inflicted by the Carthaginians on their unsuccessful generals.

After a fruitless attempt to poison the senators at a marriage-feast, he excited a rebellion among the slaves, but his schemes were again frustrated, and he fled for refuge to a fortress in the interior, where he assembled an army of 20,000 men, and invoked the assistance of the Africans and Moors.

Famine soon made itself felt, and the <pb n=\"346\"/> populace of the city became discontented; but the Carthaginian governors contrived to send tidings of their distress to Hannibal, who hastened to their relief out of Lucania. But though Hanno and Bostar seconded his efforts, by a vigorous sally from the city against the Roman camp, while Hannibal attacked it from without, all their exertions were in vain; and the daring march of Hannibal upon Rome itself having proved equally ineffectual in compelling the consuls to dislodge their troops from before Capua, the fall of that city became inevitable.

He was thoroughly versed in the Old and New Testaments, and wrote expositions of them. The excellence of his life, and his power of persuasion, enabled him to spread his peculiar views very widely among the Egyptian ascetics. His abstinence was remarkable, but not beyond what his constitution could bear, for he is said to have lived to more than ninety years, and was distinguished to the day of his death by the undiminished clearness of his sight, and by his beautiful writing. His obnoxious opinions were a denial of the resurrection of the body, and of a heaven perceptible by the senses; the repudiation of marriage, for he believed that none of those who married could inherit the kingdom of heaven; the rejection from the <pb n=\"452\"/> kingdom of heaven of such as die before they have become moral agents, inasmuch as they can have done nothing to obtain admission, \"quia non sunt illis,\" as Augustin expresses it. \"illa merita certaminis quo vitia superantur.\" He held that the Son was truly begotten of the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was from the Father; but added that Melchizedek was the Holy Ghost.

Perhaps it was intentionally wrapt in obscurity by the commercial jealousy of the Carthaginians, and the fabulous statements just alluded to may have been designed to prevent navigators of other nations from following in the same track.

From thence he returned to Carthage; and having received from the government there, who were now determined to prosecute the war in Sicily with energy, an army of 25,000 foot and 3000 horse, he landed with this force at Heraclea Minoa, and quickly made himself master of Agrigentum. Here he was joined by Hippocrates from Syracuse; and following Marcellus, who retreated before him, he advanced to the banks of the Anapus. But the Roman camp was too strong to be forced, and Himilco, feeling confident that the Syracusans could be left to their own resources, turned his attention to the other cities of Sicily. The spirit of hostility to Rome was rapidly spreading among these, and several openly declared in favour of the Carthaginians. Murgantia, where great part of the Roman magazines had been collected, was betrayed into the hands of Himilco; and the still more important fortress of Enna was only prevented from following its example by the barbarous massacre of its inhabitants by the orders of the Roman governor, Pinarius. [<ref target=\"pinarius-bio-2\">PINARIUS.</ref>] But in the following spring (212) the surprise of the Epipolae by Marcellus, which put him in possession of three out of the five quarters of Syracuse, more than counterbalanced all these advantages of the Carthaginians. Himilco saw the necessity of an immediate effort to relieve Syracuse, and again advanced thither in conjunction with Hippocrates. But their attacks on the Roman lines were repulsed; and a pestilence, caused by the marshy ground on which they were encamped, broke out in their army, which carried off Himilco, as well as his colleague, Hippocrates.

Being young, active, and daring, and finding himself at the head of an indefatigable and hardy body of troops, he continually harassed the Roman generals, prevented their soldiers from leaving the camp for provisions or forage, and frequently attacked their detachments with success, except, it is said, when they were commanded by Scipio. By these means he became an object of terror to the Romans, and contributed greatly to the success of the Carthaginian army under Hasdrubal, especially on occasion of the march of Manilius upon Nepheris. But in the course of this irregular warfare having accidentally fallen in with Scipio (at that time one of the tribunes in the Roman army), he was led by that officer into a conference, in which Scipio induced him to abandon the cause of Carthage as hopeless, and desert to the Romans. This resolution he put in execution on occasion of the second expedition of Manilius against Nepheris (<date when-custom=\"-148\">B.

He was a disciple of Hegesidamus (Suid. <title xml:lang=\"la\">s. v.</title>), and the contemporary of Protagoras and Socrates. Owing to his talent and skill, his fellow-citizens availed themselves of his services in political matters, and in a diplomatic mission to Sparta. (Plat. <hi rend=\"ital\">Hipp. maj.</hi> pp. 281. a, 286. a; Philostr. <hi rend=\"ital\">Vit. Soph.</hi> 1.11.) But he was in every respect like the other sophists of the time: he travelled about in various towns and districts of Greece for the purpose of acquiring wealth and celebrity, by teaching and public speaking. His character as a sophist, his vanity, and his boastful arrogance, are well described in two dialogues of Plato, the <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Ἱππίας μείζων</foreign> and the <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Ἱππίας ἐλάττων</foreign> (<title xml:lang=\"la\">Hippias major</title> and <title xml:lang=\"la\">Hippias minor</title>). The former treats of the question about the beautiful, and in a manner which gives ample scope for putting the knowledge and presumption of Hiippias in a ludicrous light; the other handles the deficiency of our knowledge, and exposes the ridiculous vanity of the sophist. The latter dialogue is considered by Schleiermacher and Ast to be spurious. Ast even goes so far as to reject the Hippias major also; but it is not easy to get over the difficulty which arises from the fact of Aristotle (<bibl n=\"Aristot. Met. 5.1024b\">Aristot. Met. 5.29</bibl>) and Cicero (<bibl n=\"Cic. de Orat. 3.32\">Cic. de Orat. 3.32</bibl>) mentioning it, though without expressly ascribing it to Plato; but however this may be, the dialogues must at any rate have been written by a person and at a time when there was no difficulty in forming a correct estimate of the character of Hippias. If we compare the accounts of Plato with those given by other writers, it cannot be denied that Hippias was a man of very extensive knowledge, that he occupied himself not only with rhetorical, philosophical, and political studies, but was also well versed in poetry, music, mathematics, painting and sculpture, nay, that to a certain extent he had a practical skill in the ordinary arts of life, for he used to boast of wearing on his body nothing that he had not made himself with his own hands, such as his seal-ring, his cloak, and shoes. (Plat. <hi rend=\"ital\">Hipp. maj.</hi> p. 285. c, <hi rend=\"ital\">Hipp. min.</hi> p. 368. b, <hi rend=\"ital\">Protag.</hi> p. 315. c; Philostr. <hi rend=\"ital\">l.c.</hi>; Themist. <hi rend=\"ital\">Orat.</hi> xxix. p. 345. d.) But it is at the same time evident that his knowledge of all these things was of a superficial kind, that he did not enter into the details of any particular art or science, and that he was satisfied with certain generalities, which enabled him to speak on everything without a thorough knowledge of any. This arrogance, combined with ignorance, is the main cause which provoked Plato to his severe criticism of Hippias, in which he is the more justified, as the sophist enjoyed a very extensive reputation, and thus had a proportionate influence upon the education of the youths of the higher classes.</p>\n",

Being called in by the people of Zancle to assist them against the Samians, who had made themselves masters of their city by treachery, he suddenly turned against his allies, threw their king Scythes into chains, and reduced the mass of the people into slavery, while he gave up three hundred of the principal citizens to the mercy of the Samians, whom he allowed to retain possession of Zancle, in consideration of receiving half the booty they had found there. He also made war upon the Syracusans, whom he defeated in a great battle at the river Helorus, and appears even to have threatened Syracuse itself, as we hear of his encamping by the well-known temple of the Olympian Zeus, in the immediate neighbourhood of that city. But the intervention of the Corinthians and Corcyreans induced him to consent to the conclusion of a treaty of peace, by which the Syracusans, in exchange for the numerous prisoners he had taken at the Helorus, ceded to him the territory of Camarina, and he immediately proceeded to rebuild that city, which had been lately destroyed by the Syracusans.

Patriarch of that city in the first half of the fifth century. Cave, we know not on what authority, describes him as having, early in life, studied in the monastery of St. Euprepius, in the suburbs of Antioch, where Nestorius and Theodoret were his fellowdisciples. He succeeded Theodotus as patriarch of Antioch <date when-custom=\"427\">A. D. 427</date> according to Cave, or 428 or 429 according to Tillemont. In the then rising controversy between Cyril and Nestorius, John of Antioch, with the Eastern bishops, were disposed to favour Nestorius; and John induced Theodoret, bishop of Cyrus, and Andreas of Samosata, to charge with the Apollinarian heresy the twelve \" capitula,\" condemnatory of the doctrines of Nestorius, which had been issued by a synod held at Alexandria <date when-custom=\"429\">A. D. 429</date>, under the auspices of Cyril. When the council of Ephesus (the third general council) was called (<date when-custom=\"431\">A. D. 431</date>), John of Antioch was desirous of having no addition made to the confession of Nice, so that the doctrines of Nestorius might not be condemned; but as John was long on the road, he did not reach Ephesus till five days after the commencement of the council, when he found that the vehement Cyril had already procured the condemnation of Nestorius, and his deposition from the patriarchal see of Constantinople. With more zeal than discretion, John assembled the prelates of his partyat his own lodging, and with them issued a retaliatory anathema and deposition against Cyril, for the heretical views embodied in his \" capitula,\" and against Memnon, bishop of Ephesus, for supporting Cyril. John also (according to Cave, who does not cite his authority) took an oath never to be reconciled to Cyril, even if Cyril should consent to the condemnation of his own \" capitula.\" The council being over, John hastened to the emperor Theodosius the younger, to engage him in his cause, and at Chalcedon delivered an exhortation to the people of Constantinople who resorted to hear him, animating them to continue steadfast in adhering to the old confession of Nice. He then hastened homeward, and assembling councils of the prelates of his patriarchate at Tarsus (<date when-custom=\"431\">A. D. 431</date>) and Antioch (<date when-custom=\"431\">A. D. 431</date> or 432), repeated the declaration of the deposition of Cyril. The emperor, however, supported the decision of the council of Ephesus; and Nestorius did not recover his see, though he was allowed to reside in the monastery of St. Euprepius, where he was treated with kindness and respect. Theodosius was anxious to heal the schism, and his interposition (and, according to Liberatus, his threats of exile in case of contumacy) softened the stubbornness of John, and some explanation by Cyril of his obnoxious \" capitula\" prepared the way for a reconciliation. After the schism had continued for about a year, John accepted the conditions of an amicable arrangement offered by Cyril, and (A. D. 432) sent Paul of Emesa, one of his bishops, to Alexandria to complete the arrangement. Cyril received Paul with great respect, and pronounced in public the highest eulogium on John. John now joined in the condemnation of Nestorius; and after much trouble and opposition, which he vanquished, partly by persuasion, partly by deposing the pertinacious, succeeded in bringing over the other Eastern bishops to do the same in provincial councils held at Antioch (<date when-custom=\"432\">A. D. 432</date>), Anazarbus (<date when-custom=\"433\">A. D. 433</date>), and Tarsus (<date when-custom=\"434\">A. D. 434</date>).

Joannes Argyropulus (or Argyropylus, or Argyropolus, or Argyropilus, or Argyrophilus, for the name is variously written) was born at Constantinople of a noble family, and was a presbyter of that city, on the capture of which (<date when-custom=\"1453\">A. D. 1453</date>) he is said by Fabricius and Cave to have fled into Italy; but there is every reason to believe that his removal was antecedent to that event. Nicolaus Comnenus Papadopoli (<hi rend=\"ital\">Hist. Gymnas. Patavini</hi>) states that he was twice in Italy; that he was sent the first time when above forty years old, by Cardinal Bessarion, and studied Latin at Padua, and that his second removal was after the capture of Constantinople. What truth there is in this statement it is difficult to say : he was at least twice in Italy, probably three, and perhaps even four times ; but that he was forty years of age at his first visit is quite irreconcileable with other statements. A passage cited by Tiraboschi (<hi rend=\"ital\">Storia della Lett. Italiana,</hi> vol. vi. p. 198) makes it likely that he was at Padua <date when-custom=\"1434\">A. D. 1434</date>, reading and explaining the works of Aristotle on natural philosophy. In <date when-custom=\"1439\">A. D. 1439</date> an Argyropulus was present with the emperor Joannes Palaeologus at the council of Florence (Michael Ducas, <hi rend=\"ital\">Hist. Byzant.</hi> c. 31) : it is not clear whether this was Joannes or some other of his name, but it was probably Joannes. In <date when-custom=\"1441\">A. D. 1441</date> he was at Constantinople, as appears <pb n=\"588\"/> from a letter of Francesco Filelfo to Pietro Perleoni (Philelphus, <hi rend=\"ital\">Epistol.</hi> 5.3), engaged in public teaching, but it is uncertain how long he had been established there. Probably he had returned some time between <date when-custom=\"1434\">A. D. 1434</date> and 1439, and accompanied Bessarion to and from the council of Florence. Among his pupils at Constantinople was Michael Apostolius. Argyropulus must have left Constantinople not long after the date of the letter of Philelphus, for in 1442 he was rector of the university of Padua (Facciolati, <hi rend=\"ital\">Fasti Gymnasii Patavini</hi>); and he was still there <date when-custom=\"1444\">A. D. 1444</date>, when Francesco della Rovere, afterwards pope Sixtus IV., took his degree, not, however, as Nic. Comnen. Papadopoli (<hi rend=\"ital\">l.c.</hi>) states, as a student (discipulus), but, according to the better authority of Tiraboschi (<hi rend=\"ital\">l.c.</hi>), as master of the school of philosophy (philosophiae magister scholaris). That he returned to Constantinople after 444 is improbable, and rests on no better evidence than the assertion, chiefly of later writers, that he fled into Italy on its capture in 1453. During his abode in Italy, after his last removal thither, he was honourably received by Cosmo de' Medici, then the principal person at Florence, for whose assistance in becoming acquainted with the philosophy of Aristotle, some of his Latin versions of that great writer were made. He also assisted the studies of Piero de' Medici, son of Cosmo, and was preceptor to Lorenzo de' Medici, the celebrated son of Piero, whom he instructed in Greek and in the Aristotelian philosophy, especially in ethics. When Lorenzo, who, from his father's ill health, took a leading part in affairs during his life, and succeeded, on his death (<date when-custom=\"1469\">A. D. 1469</date>), to his pre-eminence at Florence, established the Greek academy in that city, Argyropulus read and expounded the classical Greek writers to the Florentine youth, and had several among his pupils who afterwards attained to eminence, as Angelo Poliziano (Politianus) and Donato Acciajuoli.</p>\n",

He studied at Constantinople, and attended the school of Georgius Chrysococces [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">CHRYSOCOCCES</hi>], and had for his fellow-student Francesco Filelfo (Franciscus Philelphus), as appears from a letter of Filelfo dated x.

Having embraced a monastic life in the order of St. Basil, he turned his attention from poetry and oratory, in which he had already become eminent, to theology, which he studied under two of the most learned metropolitans of the Greek church. He also studied the Platonic philosophy under Georgius Pletho or Gemistus [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">GEMISTUS</hi>], for whom he ever retained the greatest reverence, and under whom he became a zealous Platonist.

Of his previous history and opinions we have little or no information, except that he was, before his election to the patriarchate, a presbyter and syncellus of Constantinople. Subsequent events rather indicate that his original leaning was to the opponents of the Council of Chalcedon : but he had either too little firmness or too little principle to follow out steadily the inclination of his own mind, but appears to have been in a great degree the tool of others. On the death of Anastasius and the accession of Justin I. the orthodox party among the inhabitants of Constantinople raised a tumult, and compelled John to anathematize Severus of Antioch, and to insert in the diptychs the names of the fathers of the Council of Chalcedon, and restore to them those of the patriarchs Euphemius and Macedonius. These diptyehs were two tables of ecclesiastical dignitaries, one containing those who were living, and the other those who had died, in the peace and communion of the church, so that insertion was a virtual declaration of orthodoxy; erasure, of heresy or schism.

At Constantinople he pursued his studies under several teachers, and last under Michael Psellus the younger; with whom, however, he soon quarrelled, not being able, according to Anna Comnena, to enter into the subtleties of his philosophy, and being remarkable for his arrogance and disputatious temper. He is described as having a commanding figure, being moderately tall and broad-chested, with a large head, a prominent forehead, an open nostril, and wellknit limbs. He knew the Greek language well, but spoke it with a foreign accent. He acquired the favour of the emperor Michael Ducas (A. D. 1071-1078) and his brothers; and the emperor, when he was contemplating the recovery of the Byzantine portion of Italy, counting on the attachment of Italus, and expecting to derive advantage from his knowledge of that country, sent him to Dyrrachium; but having detected him in some acts of treachery, he ordered him to be removed.

According to Evagrius (or rather according to Zacharias Rhetor whom Evagrius cites as his authority) Joannes was detected in intrigues to obtain his own appointment in the event of a vacancy : perhaps his connection with Illus [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">ILLUS</hi>], whose friendship, according to Liberatus, he cultivated by costly presents, excited the jealousy and apprehensions of the emperor. However this might be, though Zeno granted to the Alexandrians the liberty which they had requested, he bound Joannes by a solemn oath not to seek the succession for himself. Soon after the return of Joannes, Tinothus Salophaciolus died (<date when-custom=\"48\">A. D. 48</date> 1), and Joannes was elected to succeed him, but was almost immediately expelled from his see by order of the emperor. The cause of his expulsion is differently stated. Liberatus says that he was expelled mainly through the jealousy of Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, to whom on different occasions he had failed in paying due attention. According to Evagrius, who quotes Zacharias as his authority, he was detected in having procured his own election by bribery, and thus breaking the oath which the emperor had constrained him to take. The circumstances of the times make it probable that his connection with Illus, then the object of jealousy and suspicion to Zeno, if not actually in rebellion against him [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">ILLUS</hi>], had much to do with his expulsion, and was perhaps the chief cause of it. Joannes, expelled from Alexandria, first resorted to Illus, then at Antioch; and having through his intervention obtained from the patriarch of Antioch and his suffragans a synodical letter commending him to the Pope (Simplicius), departed to Rome to plead <pb n=\"603\"/> his cause there in person. Simplicius, with the usual papal jealousy of the patriarchs of Constantinople, took the side of Joannes against Acacius and Zeno, the latter of whom replied that Joannes had been expelled for perjury, and for that alone; but neither the exertions of Simplicius nor those of his successor Felix, could obtain the restoration of the banished patriarch. Joannes after a time accepted from Felix the bishopric of Nola in Campania, where he lived many years, and at last died peaceably.</p>\n",

[No. 3.] He retained all the republican feelings of his family, and, unlike most of his contemporaries, never became reconciled to the imperial government, but took every opportunity to attack Augustus and his friends. In consequence of his bitterness he received the nickname of <hi rend=\"ital\">Rabienus</hi> from the imperial party. He was an intimate friend of Cassius Severus, and an <pb n=\"699\"/> enemy of Asinius Pollio, whom he branded in one of his orations as the <hi rend=\"ital\">casnar</hi> or parasite of Augustus. He is represented by the elder Seneca as very poor, of an infamous character, and universally hated; but his oratorical talents must have been very great, as Seneca justly remarks, to have obtailed under these circumstances the remarkable reputation which he enjoyed as an orator. In his speeches lie adopted a style of oratory which partook of the leading characteristics both of the ancient and modern schools, so that each party could claim him. The history which Labienus wrote was apparently one of his own times; since the elder Seneca relates, that when he heard him on one occasion reading his history, he passed over a great part, remarking that it could only be read after his death; but if the work had related merely to past times,he probably would not have feared to have read it. Labienus seems never to have been engaged in any plots against Augustus; but his enemies at length revenged themselves upon him, by obtaining a decree of the senate that all his writings should be burnt. This indignity affected Labienus so much, that, resolving not to survive the productions of his genius, he shut himself up in the tombs of his ancestors, and thus perished. His death probably took place in <date when-custom=\"12\">A. D. 12</date>, as Dio Cassius relates (56.27) that several libellous works were burnt in that year. Caligula allowed the writings of Labienus, as well as those of Cremutius Cordus and Cassius Severus, which had shared the same fate, to be again collected and read.

The remainder of the whole tribe who had escaped from the carnage determined on surrendering themselves to the mercy of the Roman general; but they were all sold as slaves, and their city plundered and destroyed. When this news reached Rome, the senate disapproved of Popillius's proceedings, and decreed, in spite of his haughty and angry remonstrances, that he should restore the Ligurians to liberty, to their country, and, as far as possible, to their property. Popillius, however, acted in direct opposition to this decree. On his return to Rome he was called to account, but escaped through the influence of his family.

(<bibl n=\"Liv. 43.19\">Liv. 43.19</bibl>, <bibl n=\"Liv. 43.24\">24</bibl>.) The haughtiness of his character is most apparent in his behaviour as ambassador to Antiochus, king of Syria, whom the senate wished to abstain from hostilities against Egypt. Antiochus was just marching upon Alexandria when he was met by the three Roman ambassadors. Popillius transmitted to him the letter of the senate, which Antiochus read and promised to take into consideration with his friends. Then Popillius described with his cane a circle in the sand round the king, and ordered him not to stir out of it before he had given a decisive answer. This boldness so frightened Antiochus, that he at once yielded to the demand of Rome. (<bibl n=\"Liv. 45.12\">Liv. 45.12</bibl>; Polyb. <hi rend=\"ital\">Exc. Legat.</hi> 92;\n",

But at that crisis of the second Punic war--the year following the defeat at Cannae-all the civil magistrates were employed in military commands; and Laevinus, with the legions lately returned from Sicily, was stationed in Apulia, and a fleet of twenty-five gallies was attached to his land-forces, that he might watch the coast of Italy from Brundisium to Tarentum. While he lay encamped near Luceria, his outposts brought in the ambassadors of Philip IV. of Macedonia, whom they had intercepted on their way to Hannibal's quarters. Laevinus, however, deceived as to the purpose of their mission by Xenophanes, the chief of the legation, furnished them with guides and an escort to Rome. [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">XENOPHANES.</hi>] During the autumn of the same year he retook three towns of the Hirpinians, which, after the defeat at Cannae, had revolted to Hannibal. Having placed garrisons in Tarentum and Rhegium, Laevinus with one legion wintered at Brundisium, from whence he watched the eastern coast of Italy, where a Macedonian invasion was expected. Envoys from Oricum, in Epeirus, came to his winter-quarters, announcing the capture of their own city by Philip, and the imminent danger of Apollonia. Laevinus immediately crossed the Adriatic, recovered Oricum, and by a detachment under Q. Naevius Crista, one of his lieutenants, raised the siege of Apollonia, took Philip's camp, and concluded a league between the Aetolians and Rome. The terms of the league may be gathered from Polybius (<bibl n=\"Plb. 9.28\">9.28</bibl>, &amp;c.). Laevinus was four times re-appointed pro-praetor, <date when-custom=\"-214\">B. C. 214</date>, 213, 212, 211. In the first of these years he wintered at Oricum; inc the second, and in 212, 211, he watched the movements of Philip in Aetolia and Achaia. At the comitia in <date when-custom=\"-211\">B. C. 211</date>, on account of his services in Northern Greece, he was elected consul without solicitation, in his absence. In the latter part of <date when-custom=\"-211\">B. C. 211</date> he drove the Macedonians from the island of Zacynthus, and from Oeniadae and Nasus in Acarnania. He wintered at Corcyra, and in the following spring took Anticyra, when the news of his election to the consulship reached him.

      "badn laodice-bio-8 laodice-bio 8      <p>2. Wife of Antiochus II. Theos, king of Syria, and mother of Seleucus Callinicus. According to Eusebius (Euseb. <hi rend=\"ital\">Arm.</hi> p. 164), she was a daughter of Achaeus, probably the same as the father of Antiochis, who was mother of Attalus I., king of Pergamus. (See Clinton. <hi rend=\"ital\">F. H.</hi> iii. pp. 310, 401.) The statement of Polyaenus (<bibl n=\"Polyaen. 8.50\">8.50</bibl>), that she was a daughter of Antiochus Soter, though followed by Froelich (<hi rend=\"ital\">Ann. Reg. Syriac.</hi> p. 26), is probably erroneous. (See Niebuhr, <hi rend=\"ital\">Kl. Schrift.</hi> p. 257; Droysen, <hi rend=\"ital\">Hellenism.</hi> ii. p. 317.) By the peace concluded between Antiochus and Ptolemy Philadelphus (<date when-custom=\"-248\">B. C. 248</date>), it was agreed that the former should marry Berenice, the sister of the Egyptian monarch, and should not only put away Laodice, but declare her children illegitimate. Antiochus complied for a time, but as soon as he heard of the death of Ptolemy he hastened to recal Laodice and her children. The latter, however, either mistrusting her husband's constancy, and apprehensive of a second change, or in revenge for the slight already put upon her, took an early opportunity to put an end to his life by poison (<date when-custom=\"-246\">B. C. 246</date>); at the same time artfully concealing his death until she had taken all necessary measures, and was able to establish her son Seleucus at once upon the throne. Her next step was to order the execution of her rival Berenice and her infant son, who were put to death in the sacred grove of Daphne, where they had taken refuge. An incidental notice, preserved to us by Athenaeus (xiii. p. 593), shows that these were far from being the only victims sacrificed to her vengeance. But she did not long retain the power acquired by so many crimes. The people of Syria broke out into revolt; and Ptolemy Euergetes having invaded the kingdom, to avenge his sister's fate, overran almost the whole country. According to Appian, laodice herself fell into his hands, and was put to death; Plutarch, on the contrary (<hi rend=\"ital\">De Fratern. Amor.</hi> 18, p. 489), represents her as surviving this war, and afterwards stimulating her youngest son, Antiochus Hierax, to make war on his brother Selencus.

Hostilius Mancinus, who had been defeated by the Numantines [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">MANCINUS 4</hi>]; and while he was waiting for reinforcements from home, as he was not yet in a condition to attack the Numantines, he resolved to make war upon the Vaccaei, under the pretence of their having assisted the Numantines. This he did merely from the desire of distinguishing himself; and the senate, immediately his intention became known, sent deputies to command him to desist from his design, as they deprecated a new war in Spain, after experiencing so many disasters. Lepidus, however, had commenced the war before the deputies arrived, and had summoned to his assistance his relation, D. Brutus, who commanded in Further Spain, and was a general of considerable experience and skill. [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">BRUTUS</hi>, No. 15, p. 509b.] Notwithstanding his aid, Lepidus was unsuccessful. After laying waste the open country, the two generals laid siege to Pallantia, the capital of the Vaccaei (the modern Palencia), but they suffered so dreadfully from want of provisions, that they were obliged to raise the siege; and a considerable part of their army was destroyed by the enemy in their retreat.

Indeed at first he attempted to dissuade Crassus from invading the country of the Parthians at all, and recommended him to take up a strong position on the Euphrates. In the fatal battle of Carrhae Cassius commanded one of the wings of the Roman army, and recommended the Roman general to extend his line, in order to prevent the enemy from attacking them on their flank, and likewise to distribute cavalry on the wings; but here again his advice was not followed. After the defeat of the Roman army, Cassius and the legate, Octavius, conducted the remnants of it back to Carrhae, as Crassus had entirely lost all presence of mind, and was incapable of giving any orders. So highly was Cassius thought of by the Roman <pb n=\"800\"/> soldiers, that they offered him in Carrhae the supreme command of the army; but this he declined, although Crassus, in his despondency, was quite willing to resign it. In the retreat from Carrhae, which they were soon afterwards obliged to make, Crassus was misled by the guides, and killed [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">CRASSUS</hi>, p. 878]; but Cassius, suspecting treachery, returned to Carrhae, and thence made his escape to Syria with 500 horsemen by another way. After crossing the Euphrates, he collected the remains of the Roman army, and made preparations to defend the province against the Parthians.

Att. 5.21\">Cic. Att. 5.21</bibl>) the <hi rend=\"ital\">frater</hi> of C. Cassius [No. 11], by which he probably means the first cousin rather than the brother of Caius, more especially as both Quintus and Caius were tribunes of the plebs in the same year. The public life of Quintus commenced and ended in Spain. In <date when-custom=\"-54\">B. C. 54</date> he went as the quaestor of Pompey into that country, and availed himself of the absence of the triumvir to accumulate vast treasures in Further Spain. His conduct was so rapacious and cruel, that a plot was formed to take away his life. In <date when-custom=\"-49\">B. C. 49</date> he was tribune of the plebs, and, in conjunction with his colleague M. Antony, warmly opposed the measures of the aristocracy. They put their veto upon the decrees of the senate, and when they were driven out of the senate-house by the consuls on the 6th of January, they left Rome, and fled to Caesar's camp. Caesar's victorious advance through Italy soon restored them to the city, and it was they who summoned the senate to receive the conqueror. Upon Caesar's setting out for Spain in the course of this year, in order to oppose Afranius and Petreius, the legates of Pompey, he took Cassius with him; and after the defeat of the Pompeians, when he departed from the province, he left Cassius governor of Further Spain. Hated by the inhabitants, on account of his former exactions, and anxious to accumulate still further treasures, he was obliged to rely entirely upon the support of his soldiers, whose favour he courted by presents and indulgencies of every kind. Meantime, he received orders from Caesar to pass over to Africa, in order to prosecute the war against Juba, king of Numidia, who had espoused the side of Pompey; orders which delighted him much, as Africa afforded a fine field for plunder. Accordingly, in <date when-custom=\"-48\">B. C. 48</date>, he collected his army at Corduba; but while he was thus employed, a conspiracy broke out which had been formed against him by the provincials, and in which many of his troops joined. He was openly attacked in the market-place of Corduba, and received many wounds: the conspirators, thinking that he was killed, chose L. Laterensis as his successor. [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">LATERENSIS</hi>, No. 2.] Cassius, however, escaped with his life, succeeded in putting down the insurrection, and executed Laterensis and all the other conspirators who were unable to purchase their lives. The province was treated with greater severity than ever. Shortly afterwards two legions, which had formerly served under Varro, the legate of Pompey, and which were marching to Calpe to be shipped for Africa, openly declared against Cassius, and elected one T. Torius as their commander. The inhabitants of Corduba also rose in insurrection, and the quaestor, M. Marcellus Aeserninus, who had been sent by Cassius to quiet the town, placed himself at their head. Cassius immediately sent to Bogud, king of Mauritania, and to M. Lepidus, who commanded in Nearer Gaul, for succours; and till these should arrive, he took up a strong position on a hill, about 4000 paces from Corduba, from which it was separated by the river Baetis (Guadalquiver). From this position, however, he was obliged to retire, and take refuge in the town of Ulia, which Marcellus proceeded to enclose by lines of circumvallation. But before these were completed Bogud came to his assistance, and shortly afterwards Lepidus appeared with a numerous force. The latter called upon Marcellus and Cassius to lay aside hostilities; Marcellus immediately obeyed, and joined Lepidus, but Cassius hesitated to place himself in his power, and asked for a free departure. This was granted to him; and as he heard about the same time that his successor, C. Trebonius, had arrived in the province, he hastened to place his troops in winter-quarters (<date when-custom=\"-47\">B. C. 47</date>), and to escape from the province with his treasures. He embarked at Malaca, but his ship sank, and he was lost, at the mouth of the Iberus. (<bibl n=\"Cic. Att. 5.20\">Cic. Att. 5.20</bibl>, <bibl n=\"Cic. Att. 5.21\">21</bibl>, <bibl n=\"Cic.

[See above, No. 11.] On his return to Rome he was regarded as one of the leading men in the state, and possessed great influence both by the integrity of his character and his ample fortune. On these accounts he became an object of suspicion to the emperor Nero, who imputed to him as a crime that, among his ancestral images, he had a statue of Cassius, the murderer of Caesar, and accordingly required the senate to pronounce a sentence of banishment against him, <date when-custom=\"66\">A.

C. 151</date>, together with A. Postumius Albinus, and was appointed to succeed M. Marcellus in the command in Spain. The war which was then going on in that country against the Celtiberians appears to have been unpopular at Rome, so that some difficulty was found in raising the necessary levies; and the severity with which these were enforced by Lucullus and his colleague, irritated the people and the tribunes to such a degree, that the latter went so far as to arrest both consuls, and to cast them into prison. These dissensions were at length terminated by the intervention of the young Scipio Aemilianus, who volunteered his services, and succeeded in reviving the military ardour of the populace. (<bibl n=\"Plb. 35.3\">Plb. 35.3</bibl>, <bibl n=\"Plb. 35.4\">4</bibl>; Liv. <hi rend=\"ital\">Epit.</hi> xlviii; Appian, <bibl n=\"App. Hisp. 9.49\">App. Hisp. 49</bibl>; <bibl n=\"Oros. 4.21\">Oros. 4.21</bibl>.) But before the arrival of Lucullus in Spain, the war with the Celtiberians had been completely terminated by Marcellus, and all tribes previously in arms had submitted. The new consul, however, greedy both of glory and plunder, and finding himself disappointed of his expected foes, now turned his arms against the Vaccaeans, a tribe who had hitherto had no relations with the Romans, and proceeded to cross the Tagus and invade their territories, without any authority from the senate. His first attacks were directed against the city of Cauca, which was readily induced to submit, on terms of capitulation; but these were shamefully violated by Lucullus, who had no sooner made himself master of the town than he caused all the inhabitants to be put to the sword, to the number of near 20,000. Front hence he advanced into the heart of the country, crossed the Douro, and laid siege to Intercatia, a strong city which for a long time defied his arms, but was at length induced to submit on favourable terms, the inviolability of which was guaranteed to them by Scipio. A subsequent attack upon Pallantia was wholly unsuccessful; and Lucullus, after suffering severely from hunger, and being hard pressed by the enemy, was compelled to recross the Douro, and take up his winter-quarters in the south of Spain. But notwithstanding this ignominious termination of a war as unwarranted by authority from Rome as it was unjust in itself, no notice was taken of the proceedings of Lucullus, who coninued in Spain, with the rank of proconsul.

The war against the Vaccaeans, though prompted chiefly by the avarice of Lucullus, had brought him but little booty; but he appears to have, by some means or other, amassed great wealth during the period of his government, a part of which he devoted to the construction of a temple of Good Fortune (Felicitas). It is a very characteristic trait, that having borrowed from L.

Antiochus had collected a powerful army to put down the revolt, but being called to the eastern provinces of his empire (B.

The death of Antiochus Epiphanes, which happened in this year at Tabae in Persia, and the struggle which arose between Lysias and Philip for the guardianship of the young Antiochus Eupator and for the administration of the empire, paralysed for the time the exertions of the Syrians. Judas and his brothers entered Jerusalem in <date when-custom=\"-163\">B.

Meantime, however, Lysias, with the aid of the apostate Jews, had again collected a formidable army, with which he marched against Judas, accompanied by the young king. His forces were arrested by the strong fortress of Bethsura, which commands the narrow passes that lead to Jerusalem; and notwithstanding an heroic battle near this place, in which Eleazar, the brother of Judas, perished, the town was obliged to capitulate and Judas to retire to Jerusalem. Here Judas shut himself up, and successfully resisted all the attempts of Lysias to take the place; but as both parties suffered dreadfully from famine, and the approach of Philip made Lysias anxious to be at liberty to oppose his rival, a treaty was concluded between Judas and Lysias, and the latter withdrew his troops.</p>\n",

About the same time another of the brothers, John, fell in battle.

In 393 he advanced against Messana, but was attacked and defeated by Dionysius near Abacaenum, which compelled him to remain quiet for a time. The next year, however, having received powerful reinforcements from Sardinia and Africa, he assembled an army of 80,000 men, with which he advanced through the heart of Sicily as far as the river Chrysas, but was there met by Dion sins, who having secured the alliance of Agyris, tyrant of Agyrium, succeeded in cutting off the supplies of the enemy, and by this means reduced them to such distress, that Mago was compelled to conclude a treaty of peace, by which he abandoned his allies the Sicilians to the power of Dionysius.

A Carthaginian leader who, according to Justin, was one of the first that extended the power and dominion of his country, first, by successful wars against the African tribes, and afterwards by the subjugation of great part of Sicily. But, having subsequently crossed into Sardinia, he was defeated in a great battle; on account of which disaster he was disgraced and banished by his countrymen. In revenge for this he led his army to Carthage and laid siege to the city. His son Carthalo was in vain sent to intercede with him; he was crucified by order of Malchus himself within sight of the walls. Yet, having at length made himself master of the city, he was content with putting to death ten of the principal senators, and left the rest in possession of the chief power, of which they soon after availed themselves to bring him to trial and condemn him to death. (Justin, <bibl n=\"Just. 18.7\">18.7</bibl>.) Orosius, who has merely abridged the narrative of Justin, adds that these events took place during the reign of Cyrus the Great (<bibl n=\"Oros. 4.6\">Oros. 4.6</bibl>), but this is probably a mere inference from the statement of Justin, that Malchus was followed in the command by Mago.

He was defeated by the Numantines in several engagements, and at length, being entirely surrounded by the enemy, he negotiated a peace, through the intervention of his quaestor Tib. Gracchus, who was greatly respected by the enemy. Appian says that this peace contained the same terms for the Romans and Numantines; but as it must in that case have recognised the independence of the latter, the senate refused to recognise it, and went through the hypocritical ceremony of delivering over the consul <pb n=\"915\"/> bound and naked to the enemy, by means of the fetiales. This was done with the consent of Mancinus, but the enemy refused to accept him. On his return to Rome Mancinus took his seat in the senate, as heretofore, but was violently expelled from it by the tribune P. Rutilius, on the ground that he had lost his citizenship.

He is constantly confounded with his cousin, C. Marcellus [No. 14] who was consul in the year 50 with L. Aemilius Paullus, a confusion little to be wondered at: indeed it is sometimes impossible to determine which of the two is meant. Matters were fast approaching to a crisis when he and his colleague, L. Cornelius Lentulus, entered upon their office. While yet only consuls elect, they had lent their countenance to the violent and illegal act of the consul C. Marcellus in investing Pompey with the command of the army without authority from the senate (<bibl n=\"D. C. 40.66\">D. C. 40.66</bibl>); and on the very first day of their consulship (1 Jan. <date when-custom=\"-49\">B. C. 49</date>) they brought under the consideration of the senate the measures to be taken in regard to Caesar, who was then at Ravenna, and from whom letters had been presented by Curio. It does not appear that Marcellus took any prominent part in the debates that ensued, and the violent proceedings which led to the flight of the tribunes and the actual breaking out of the war; but neither do we learn that he attempted to check the intemperate zeal of his colleague, and the other leaders of the war party. He appears indeed, so far as we can judge, to have been a man of small abilities, who was put forward as a tool by the more violent partisans of Pompey. On the breaking out of the war he accompanied his colleague, Lentulus, in his hasty flight from Rome, took part in the subsequent proceedings at Capua, and eventually crossed over to Dyrrhachium with a part of the army of Pompey. In the following year (<date when-custom=\"-48\">B. C. 48</date>) we find him mentioned as commanding a part of Pompey's fleet (<bibl n=\"Caes. Civ. 3.5\">Caes. Civ. 3.5</bibl>); but this is the last we hear of him, and it therefore seems probable, as suggested by Drumann, that he perished in the civil war. (<bibl n=\"D. C. 41.1\">D.

But though the two leaders, with their armies, were for some time opposed to one another, Marcellus avoided coming to a general engagement; and on the arrival soon after of the proconsul, M. Lepidus, he hastened to submit to his authority, and place the legions under his command at his disposal. By the questionable part he had acted on this occasion Marcellus at first incurred the resentment of Caesar, but was afterwards restored to favour. (Hirt. <hi rend=\"ital\">B.

These critics ascribe to him the confession agreed upon by the council of Ariminum, <date when-custom=\"359\">A. D. 359</date>, and also given by Socrates.

He appears to have survived their cruelty, at least not to have died under their hands; but we read no more of him. His sufferings for the Christian religion seem to have obliterated the discredit of his Arianism; for Gregory Nazianzen has eulogised him in the highest terms, and the Greek church honours him as a martyr.

      "badn meletius-bio-2 meletius-bio 2      <p>1. an eminent Greek ecclesiastic of the fourth century. He was born at Melitene, near the right bank of the Euphrates, in the district of Melitene, in Armenia Minor. His parents were persons of rank, at least of respectable condition (Gregor. Nyssen. <hi rend=\"ital\">Oratio habit. in funere Meletii),</hi> and he probably inherited from them an estate which he possessed in Armenia. (Basil. <hi rend=\"ital\">Epist.</hi> 187, editt. vett., 99, ed. Benedict.) His gentleness of disposition, general excellence of charafter, and persuasive eloquence, acquired for him a high reputation: but his first bishopric, that of the Sebaste, in Armenia, in which he succeeded Eustathius [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">EUSTATHIUS</hi>, No. 7], apparently after the latter had been deposed in the council of Melitene (<date when-custom=\"357\">A. D. 357</date>), proved so troublesome, through the contumacy of his people, that he withdrew from his charge and retired to Beroea, now Aleppo in Syria, of which city, according to one rendering of a doubtful expression in Socrates, he became bishop. The East was atthis time torn with the Arian controversy ; but the character of Meletius won the respect of both parties, and each appears to have regarded him as belonging to them, a result promoted by his dwelling, in his discourses, on practical rather than polemical subjects. According to Philostorgius he feigned himself an Arian, and subscribed the Confession of the Western bishops, probably that of Ariminum; and, according to Socrates, he subscribed the creed of the Acacians, at Selenceia in <date when-custom=\"359\">A. D. 359</date>. These concurrent testimonies fix on him the charge either of instability or dissimulation. Still his real tendency to the Homoousian doctrine was known to or suspected by many; and, therefore, when, by the influence of Acacius and the Arians, he was appointed to the see of Antioch (<date when-custom=\"360\">A. D. 360</date> or 361), all the bishops, clergy, and people of the city and neighbourhood, Arians and Orthodox, went out to meet him. Even the Jews and Heathens flocked to see a person who had already attained so great celebrity. For a time, but apparently a very short time, he confined himself to practical subjects, avoiding or speaking ambiguously on the doctrines in dispute between the contending parties, but presently gave more open indications of his adherence to the orthodox party. It was probably to draw out his sentiments more distinctly that he was desired by the emperor Constantius to give an exposition of the passage, Prov. 8.22. [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">GEORGIUS</hi>, No. 29.] He was preceded in the pulpit by George of Laodiceia and by Acacius of Caesareia, who gave explanations more or less heterodox; and when Meletius in his turn came to speak, ann avowed his adherence to the orthodox doctrine, a scene of great excitement ensued, the people applauding, and the Arians among the clergy, especially the archdeacon, attempting to stop his mouth. Determined now to get rid of him, the Arians charged him with Sabellianism, and persuaded the emperor to depose him and banish him, apparently on a charge either of perjury or of having violated the discipline of the church, to his native country, Melitene, while Euzoius was appointed bishop of Antioch in his room (<date when-custom=\"361\">A. D. 361</date>). This step led to an immediate and extensive schism: the orthodox party broke off from the communion of the Arians, and met in the church of the Apostles, in what was called the old town of Antioch. There had been a previous secession of the more zealous part of the orthodox on occasion of the deposition of Eustathius (A. D. 331),butthetwo seceding bodies remained separate, the Eustathians objecting that Meletius had been ordained by Arians. On the accession of the emperor Julian Meletius returned to Antioch (<date when-custom=\"362\">A. D.\n",

      "badn meletius-bio-4 meletius-bio 4      <p>3. a schismatical bishop of the third and fourth centuries. There is a remarkable discrepancy in the accounts given of this person. According to Athanasius, whose contests with the Meletians render his testimony less trustworthy, Meletius, who was bishop of Lycopolis in Upper Egypt at the time of the persecution under Diocletian and his successors, yielded to fear and sacrificed to idols; and being subsequently deposed, on this and other charges, in a synod, over which Petrus or Peter, bishop of Alexandria, presided, determined to separate from the church, and to constitute with his followers a separate community. Epiphanius, on the other hand, relates that both Peter and Meletius being in confinement for the faith, differed concerning the treatment to be used toward those who, after renouncing their Christian profession, became penitent and wished to be restored to the communion of the Church. He states that Peter, who was willing to receive them, was opposed by Meletius, who was next to Peter in influence, and had, in fact, the larger number of followers on this question: and the schism which arose on this account he represents as owing rather to the former than to the latter. Although the ecclesiastical historians Socrates and Theodoret have adopted, wholly or partially, the account of Athanasius, the statement of Epiphanius is the more probable. Had Meletius been convicted, as Athanasius states, it is hardly probable that either he would have been able to raise and keep up so formidable a schism, or that the Council of Nice (which left him the title of bishop, though it deprived him of the power to ordain) would have dealt so leniently with him. The Council allowed those whom he had ordained to retain the priestly office, on condition of re-ordination, and of their yielding precedence to those whose first ordination had been regular. The schisn begun in prison was continued in the mines of Phaeinon, in Arabia Petraea, to which Meletius and others were banished, and after their release. Meletius ordained bishops, presbyters, and deacons, and kept his followers a distinct body, under the title of \" the Church of the Martyrs.\" He even extended his sect into Palestine, where he visited Jerusalem, Eleutheropolis, and Gaza, and ordained many in those towns to the priesthood. In this state matters remained till the Nicene Council (A. D. 325), the sentence of which has been already Mentioned. The synodical letter to the Egyptian clergy, which notifies the sentence, gives no informaation as to the origin of the schism: it describes, indeed, Meletius as disorderly, hasty, and headstrong; characteristics more in harmony with the conduct ascribed to him by Epiphanius, than with the charges of Athanasius.</p>\n",

Taking advantage of the power thus entrusted to him, and aided by his father, who had raised a rebellion at home, Nectanabis persuaded his troops to renounce their allegiance to Tachos, and revolted. Being acknowlodged by the Egyptian people also as king, he made overtures and large promises to Agesilaus and Chabrias, both of whom were engaged with Greek mercenaries in the service of Tachos. Chabrias refused to transfer his assistance to him, but he was more fortunate with Agesilaus, and Tachos, finding himself thus deserted, fled for refuge to Artaxerxes II., and, notwithstanding the confused statement of Diodorus to the contrary, seems to have made no further attempt to recover the crown. It was, however, disputed with Nectanabis by a certain Mendesian, who for some time met with considerable success, but was ultimately defeated by the skill of Agesilaus, and the Spartan king left Egypt with rich presents from Nectanabis, whom he had thus firmly established on the throne.

Owing to the rapidity of his utterance and the difficulty of the subjects on which he treated, he was understood by very few. When his lectures were concluded, Proclus used to repeat the topics treated of in them for the benefit of those pupils who were slower in catching the meaning of their master.

This wooden image having been burnt at some unknown period, it was not only not replaced, but the worship of the goddess was neglected; until the Phigaleians, warned by the failure of their crops, and instructed by a Pythian oracle, employed Onatas to make a bronze statue of the goddess; in the execution of which he was assisted somewhat by a picture or a wooden copy of the old image, but still more by dreams.

There is no reason, therefore, to doubt that the election of Paul was free and spontaneous on the part of the church at Antioch; and this circumstance, combined with the silence of the ecclesiastical writers, who would gladly have laid hold of any thing to his disadvantage, leads to the conclusion that his character before his elevation was not only free from any serious blemish, but so commendable as to lead to his being raised from an originally humble condition to the highest dignity in the church.</p>\n",

The latter article is taken from Diogenes Laertius (6.75, 76), who mentions the name of the father, Onesicritus, and who evidently only speaks of one cynic philosopher of the name of Philiscus (comp. 6.73, 80, 84). This is, therefore, very probably one of the many cases in which Suidas makes two articles out of the same name, by copying statements from two different authors. We do not see the force of Naeke's argument (<hi rend=\"ital\">Sched.

Orelli) that this Piso belonged to the family of the Frugi; but this is a mistake, as Drumann has shown (<hi rend=\"ital\">Gesch. Roms,</hi> vol. ii. p. 62). Our principal information respecting Piso is derived from several of the orations of Cicero, who paints him in the blackest colours; but as Piso was both a political and a personal enemy of the orator, we must make great deductions from his description which is evidently exaggerated. Still, after making every deduction, we know enough of his life to convince us that he was an unprincipled debauchee and a cruel and corrupt magistrate, a fair sample of his noble contemporaries, neither better nor worse than the majority of them. He is first mentioned in <date when-custom=\"-59\">B. C. 59</date>, when he was brought to trial by P. Clodius for plundering a province, of which he had the administration after his praetorship, and he was only acquitted by throwing himself at the feet of the judges (<bibl n=\"V. Max. 8.1.6\">V. Max. 8.1.6</bibl>). In the same year Caesar married his daughter Calpurnia. Through his influence Piso obtained the consulship for the following year <date when-custom=\"-58\">B. C. 58</date>, having for his colleague A. Gabinius, who was indebted for the honour to Pompey. The new consuls were the mere instruments of the triumvirs, and took care that the senate should do nothing in opposition to the wishes of their patrons. When the triumvirs had resolved to sacrifice Cicero, the consuls of course threw no obstacle in their way; but Clodius, to make sure of their support, promised Piso the province of Macedonia, and Gabinius that of Syria, and brought a bill before the people to that effect, although the senate was the constitutional body to dispose of the provinces. The banishment of Cicero soon followed. Piso took an active part in the measures of Clodius, and joined him in celebrating their victory. Cicero accuses him of transferring to his own house the spoils of Cicero's dwellings. The conduct of Piso in support of Clodius produced that extreme resentment in the mind of Cicero, which he displayed against Piso on many subsequent occasions. At the expiration of his consulship Piso went to his province of Macedonia, where he remained during two years, <date when-custom=\"-57\">B. C. 57</date> and 56, plundering the province in the most shameless manner. In the latter of these years the senate resolved that a successor should be appointed, and accordingly, to his great mortification and rage, he had to resign the government in <date when-custom=\"-55\">B. C. 55</date> to Q. Ancharius. In the debate in the senate, which led to his recal and likewise to that of Gabinius, Cicero had an opportunity of giving vent to the wrath which had long been raging within him, and accordingly in the speech which he delivered on the occasion, and which has come down to us (<hi rend=\"ital\">De Provinciis Consularibus</hi>), he poured forth a torrent of invective against Piso, accusing him of every possible crime in the government of his province. Piso on his return, <date when-custom=\"-55\">B. C. 55</date>, complained in the senate of the attack of Cicero, and justified the administration of his province, whereupon Cicero reiterated his charges in a speech (<hi rend=\"ital\">In Pisonem</hi>), in which he portrays the whole public and private life of his enemy with the choicest words of virulence and abuse that the Latin language could supply. Cicero, however, did not venture to bring to trial the father-in-law of Caesar.</p>\n",

He belonged to the high aristocratical party, and, as consul, led the opposition to the proposed law of the tribune Gabinius, by which Pompey was to be entrusted with extraordinary powers for the purpose of conducting the war against the pirates. Piso even went so far as to threaten Pompey's life, telling him, \"that if he emulated Romulus, he would not escape the end of Romulus,\" for which imprudent speech he was nearly torn to pieces by the people. The law, however, was carried, notwithstanding all the opposition of Piso and his party; and when shortly afterwards the orders which Pompey had issued, were not carried into execution in Narbonese Gaul, in consequence, as it was supposed, of the intrigues of Piso, Gabinius proposed to deprive the latter of his consulship, an extreme measure which Pompey's prudence would not allow to be brought forward. Piso had not an easy life in this consulship. In the same year the tribune, C. Cornelius, proposed several laws, which were directed against the shameless abuses of the aristocracy.

C. 66</date>, a conspiracy to murder the new consuls when they entered upon their office on the 1st of January in the following year.

[<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">CATILINA</hi>, p. 629b.] Although no doubt was entertained of the existence of the conspiracy, still there were not sufficient proofs to convict the parties, and they were not therefore brought to trial. It had been arranged by the conspirators, that after the murder of the consuls, Piso was to be despatched, with an army, to seize the Spains; and the senate, in order to get rid of this dangerous agitator, now sent him into Nearer Spain as quaestor, but with the rank and title of propraetor. By his removal the senate hoped to weaken his faction at Rome, and they gave him an opportunity of acquiring, by the plunder of the province, the money of which he was so much in need. His exactions, however, in the province soon made him so hateful to the inhabitants, that he was nurdered by them. Some persons, however, supposed that he was murdered at the instigation of Pompey, who had possessed great influence in the country ever since the conquest of Sertorius. Crassus had been in favour of sending Piso to Spain, that he might, by Piso's means, persecute the friends of his great enemy and rival, Pompey; and it was therefore thought that the latter had revenged himself, by making away with the new governor.

He is first mentioned in <date when-custom=\"16\">A.

In the same year he gave another instance of the little respect which he entertained for the imperial family. Urgulania, the favourite of the empressmother, owed Piso a certain sum of money; and when she refused to obey the summons to appear before the praetor, Piso followed her to the palace of Livia, and insisted upon being paid. Although Tiberius, at the commencement of his reign, had not thought it advisable to resent the conduct of Piso, yet he was not of a temper to forgive it, and only waited for a favourable opportunity to revenge himself upon his haughty subject. Accordingly, when he considered his power sufficiently established, Q. Granius appeared in <date when-custom=\"24\">A.

On the accession of the aged Galba to the throne on the death of Nero, he adopted as his son and successor Piso Licinianus ; but the latter only enjoyed the distinction four days, for Otho, who had hoped to receive this honour, induced the praetorians to rise against the emperor.

The great works at the former place have been spoken of under <hi rend=\"smallcaps\">PHEIDIAS ;</hi> those at the latter appear to have been executed not only about the same time (or rather, perhaps, a little earlier), but also by Athenian artists chiefly. We know, for example, that the statues in the pediments of the temple at Delphi were made by <hi rend=\"smallcaps\">PRAXIAS</hi> of Athens, the disciple of Calamis, and finished, after his death, by <hi rend=\"smallcaps\">ANDROSTHENES</hi>, the disciple of Eucadmus (<bibl n=\"Paus. 10.19.3\">Paus. 10.19.3</bibl>).

The people who gave him the commission were the Cnidians. It was customary for the different Greek cities to show their piety and patriotism, not only by enriching the temple at Delphi with valuable gifts, but by embellishing its precincts with edifices, chiefly treasuries to contain their gifts. Among the rest, the Cnidians had built at Delphi both a treasury, and one of those enclosed courts, or halls, which were called <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">λέσχαι</foreign> (places for conversation), which existed in considerable numbers in various Greek cities, and which were especially attached to the temples of Apollo. The most famous of all of them was this Lesche of the Cnidians at Delphi, which seems to have been a quadrangular or oblong court or peristyle, surrounded by colonnades, very much like our cloisters. It was the walls of the two principal colonnades of this building (those on the right and left of a person entering) that Polygnotus was employed by the Cnidians to paint : and it is very interesting to observe the parallel between the most renowned works of the early stages of the art in ancient Greece and modern Italy,--the paintings of Polygnotus in the Lesche at Delphi, and those ascribed to Andrea Orcagna, in the Campo Santo at Pisa.</p>\n",

He was a man of distinction in his native city, but in consequence of the civil commotions there removed, while still young, to Athens. There he placed himself under the instructions of Adrianus, and afterwards himself taught eloquence, and had Philostratus as one of his pupils. He possessed several houses in and near Athens, and imported considerable quantities of merchandise from Egypt, which he disposed of wholesale to the ordinary vendors. After the death of his wife and son he took a concubine, to whom he entirely surrendered the control of his household, and in consequence of her mismanagement, reaped considerable discredit. It was his practice, if any one paid down 100 drachmae at once, to allow him admission to all his lectures. He also had a library, of which he allowed his pupils to make use. In the style of his discourses he imitated Hippias and Gorgias. He was remarkable for the tenacity of his memory, which he retained even in extreme old age. (Philostr. <hi rend=\"ital\">Vit.

      "badn proclus-bio-8 proclus-bio 8      <p>6. Surnamed <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Διάδοχος</foreign> (the successor), from his being regarded as the genuine successor of Plato in doctrine, was one of the most celebrated teachers of the Neoplatonic school. (Marin. c. 10. In some MSS. he is styled <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Διάδοχος Πλατωνικός.</foreign>) He was of Lycian origin, the son of Patricius and Marcella, who belonged to the city of Xanthus, which Proclus himself regarded as his native place. According, however, to the distinct statement of Marinus (<hi rend=\"ital\">Vit. Procli,</hi> c. 6) he was born at Byzantium, on the 8th of February, <date when-custom=\"412\">A. D. 412</date>, as is clear from the data furnished by his horoscope, which Marinus has preserved. The earlier period of his life was spent at Xanthus. When still very young, he was distinguished by his remarkable eagerness for study, to which Marinus believes him to have been urged by Athena herself, who appeared to him in a vision. Such watchful care, indeed, did the gods, according to that writer, take of Proclus, that he was preternaturally cured of a dangerous malady in his youth by Apollo, who appeared in his own person for the purpose. Statements like this indicate how large an abatement must be made in the extravagant account which Marinus gives of the precocity and progress of Proclus. From Xanthus he removed, while still young, to Alexandria, where his studies were conducted chiefly under the guidance of the rhetorician Leonas, who received him into his family, and treated him as though he had been his own son. Through him Proclus was introduced to the leading men and the most distinguished scholars of Alexandria, whose friendship he speedily secured by his abilities, character, and manners. He studied grammar under Orion. [<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">ORION.</hi>] He also applied himself to learn the Latin language, purposing, after the example of his father, to devote himself to the study of jurisprudence. Leonas having occasion to make a journey to Byzantium, took young Proclus with him, who eagerly embraced the opportunity of continuing his studies. On his return to Alexandria, Proclus abandoned rhetoric and law for the study of philosophy, in which his instructor was Olympiodorus. He also learnt mathematics <pb n=\"534\"/> from Hero. Whether from the confusion of his doctrines, or the indistinctness of his mode of expounding them, Olymp-odorus was rarely understood by his disciples. Proclus, by his extraordinary powers of apprehension and memory, was able, after the lectures, to repeat them almost verbatim to his fellow-pupils. He also with great ease, according to Marinus, learnt by heart the philosophical treatises of Aristotle. Olympiodorus was so delighted with him, that he offered hint his daughter in marriage. Becoming at last dissatisfied with the instruction to be obtained at Alexandria, Proclus removed to Athens, where he was received by a fellow-countryman of the name of Nicolaus. By Syrianus, with whom he formed an acquaintance, he was introduced to Plutarchus, the son of Nestorius, who was charmed with the aptitude and zeal displayed by so young a man (he was at the time not 20 years of age), so that though very old, he addressed himself to the task of instructing the young aspirant, and read with him Aristotle's treatise <title>de Anima</title> and the <title>Phaedo</title> of Plato. He even took him to reside with him, and termed him his son. Plutarchus at his death commended Proclus to the care of his successor Syrianus, who in his turn regarded him rather as a helper and ally in his philosophical pursuits, than as a disciple, and took him to cultivate with him the ascetic system of life, which was becoming the practice of the school, and soon selected him as his future successor. After a sufficient foundation had been laid by the study of Aristotle, Proclus was initiated into the philosophy of Plato and the mystic theology of the school. By his intense application and unwearied diligence, he achieved such rapid progress, that by his 28th year he had written his commentary on the Timaeus of Plato, as well as many other treatises. On the death of Syrianus he succeeded him, and inherited from him the house in which he resided and taught. The income which he derived from his school seems to have been considerable. (Phot. p. 337b. ed. Bekk.) He also found time to take part in public affairs, giving his advice on important occasions, and, by precept and example, endeavouring to guide the conduct of the leading men. Whether it was that his interference in this way provoked hostility, or (as Ritter, vol. iv. p. 658 believes) that his eager attachment to, and diligent observance of heathen practices had drawn down upon him the suspicion of violating the laws of the Christian emperors, Proclus was compelled to quit Athens for a time; he went to Asia, where he had the opportunity of making himself better acquainted with the mystic rites of the East. He himself compiled a collection of the Chaldaean oracles, on which he laboured for five years. After a year's absence, he came back to Athens. After his return he proceeded more circumspectly in his religious observances, concealing them even from his disciples, for which purpose, Marinus tells us, his house was conveniently situated. The profounder secrets of his philosophy he proclaimed only to his most confidential disciples, in meetings with respect to which it appears secrecy was enjoined (<foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">ἅγραφοι\n",

At a later period we find him entrusted by his uncle with commands of importance. Thus in <date when-custom=\"-315\">B. C. 315</date>, when Antigonus was preparing to make head against the formidable coalition organized against him, he placed Ptolemy at the head of the army which was destined to carry on operations in Asia Minor against the generals of Cassander. This object the young general successfully carried out--relieved Amisus, which was besieged by Asclepiodorus, and recovered the whole satrapy of Cappadocia; after which he advanced into Bithynia, of which he compelled the king Zipoetes to join his alliance, and then occupied Ionia, from whence Seleucus withdrew on his approach. (<bibl n=\"Diod. 19.57\">Diod. 19.57</bibl>, <bibl n=\"Diod. 19.60\">60</bibl>.) He next threatened Caria, which was however for a time defended by Myrmidon, the Egyptian general; but the following year Ptolemy was able to strike a decisive blow in that quarter against Eupolemus, the general of Cassander, whom he surprised and totally defeated. (Id. ib. 62, 68.) The next summer (<date when-custom=\"-313\">B. C. 313</date>) the arrival of Antigonus himself gave a decided preponderance to his arms in Asia Minor, and Ptolemy, after rendering active assistance in the sieges of Caunus and lasus, was sent with a considerable army to Greece to carry on the war there against Cassander. His successes were at first rapid : he drove out the garrisons of his adversary from Chalcis and Oropus, invaded Attica, where he compelled Demetrius of Phalerus to make overtures of submission, and then carried his arms triumphantly through Boeotia, Phocis, and Locris. Wherever he went he expelled the Macedonian garrisons, and proclaimed the liberty and independence of the several cities. After this he directed his march to the Peloponnese, where the authority of Antigonus had been endangered by the recent defection of his general Telesphorus. (Id. ib. 75, 77,78, 87.) Here he appears to have remained till the peace of 311 suspended hostilities in that quarter. But he considered that his services had not met with their due reward from Antigonus ; and when, therefore, in <date when-custom=\"-310\">B. C. 310</date> the kings of Macedonia and Egypt were preparing to renew the war, Ptolemy suddenly abandoned the cause of his uncle and concluded a treaty with Cassander and the son of Lagus. Probably his object was to establish himself in the chief command in the Peloponnese : but the reconciliation of Polysperchon with Cassander must have frustrated this object : and on the arrival of the Egyptian king with a fleet at Cos, Ptolemy repaired from Chalcis to join him. He was received at first with the utmost favour, but soon gave offence to. his new patron by his intrigues and ambitious demonstrations, and was in consequence thrown into prison and compelled to put an end to his life by poison, <date when-custom=\"-309\">B.

His father Basilides was a Syrian; his mother Theoclea a native of Emesa, where probably Sallustius was born, and where he lived during the earlier part of his life. He applied himself first to the study of jurisprudence, and cultivated the art of oratory with considerable diligence under the tuition of Eunoius at Emesa. He subsequently abandoned his forensic studies, and took up the profession of a sophist. He directed his attention especially to the Attic orators, and learnt all the orations of Demosthenes by heart. His own compositions were deemed not unworthy of the great models whom he imitated. Finding the instructions of Eunoius no longer of service to him, Sallustius betook himself to Alexandria, and studied under the best masters of eloquence that the city afforded. Here too he probably imbibed a taste for philosophy ; and, attracted by the fame of the Athenian school, removed to Athens, and attended the lectures of Proclus. He soon left the Neo-Platonists however, and took up with the doctrines of the Cynics, which he maintained thenceforward with great ardour. Some curious stories are told of the experiments which he made upon himself to display or increase his power of enduring pain, and his disregard of the ordinary enjoyments of life (Suidas <hi rend=\"ital\">s. v.</hi>\n",

D. 579</date> till 590. He carried on his father's war with the Greeks, to the disadvantage, though not to the disgrace, of Persia. Some time before Khosrew died, the general Justinian had advanced as far as the Caspian, which he explored by means of a Greek navy, the first that was seen on those waters since the time of Seleucus Nicator and Antiochus I. Soter, kings of Syria, whose admiral Patrocles first displayed the Greek flag on the Caspian. Seventy thousand prisoners were sent by Justinian to Cyprus, where they settled. Upon this Justinian penetrated into Assyria. In consequence of a defeat sustained by the Persian Tamchosroes, Justinian was recalled, and replaced by Mauritius, who soon retrieved the fortune of the Greek arms, and in the very year when Chosroes died (579) he took up his winter-quarters in Mesopotamia, from whence, in the following year, he penetrated into lower Mesopotamia and routed a Persian army. He gained another victory in 581, and Tamchosroes perished in the battle. But Maurice having succeeded the emperor Tiberius in that year, his general in the East, <pb n=\"721\"/> Mystacon, was twice worsted, and the armies of Hormisdas were victorious till 586, when Philippus destroyed the Persian host at Solacon near Dara. His successor Heraclius was still more successful. In the great battle of Sisarbene, in 588, the Persians were annihilated, and their camp was taken. Hormuz now concluded an alliance with the Turks, who, however, turned suddenly against him, after having been admitted into Media, and Persia would have been lost but for the splendid achievements of Bahram, who drove the barbarians back into their steppes, and compelled them to pay themselves the tribute which they had demanded from Persia. Bahram was rewarded with ingratitude, and being supported by the aristocracy turned against the king, who now reaped the fruits of his former conduct against the grandees. While Bahram advanced upon the royal residence, Hormuz was seized by Bindoes, a royal prince; and a nation that knew no other form of government than the most absolute despotism, now beheld the anomalous sight of their king being tried by the grandees, sentenced to lose his throne, to be deprived of his sight, and to end his days in captivity. Hormuz persuaded the grandees to place the diadem on his second son, but he was too much detested to meet with compliance, and his eldest son Chosroes was chosen in his stead. Bahram protested against this election with sword in hand, and Chosroes, unable to cope with him, fled to the camp of the emperor. During these troubles the blinded Hormuz was murdered by Bindoes (590). The events have been more fully related in the life of the emperor Mauricius. King Hormuz would have met with a better fate had his father's excellent minister, Abu-zurg-a-mihir, commonly called Buzurg, continued to live at his court, from which old age obliged him to retire soon after the accession of Hormuz. According to some writers, Buzurg had been minister to king Cobades (502-531); but we can hardly believe that he discharged his eminent functions during so long a period as sixty years. However, the thing is possible. This Buzurg still lives in the memory of the people as one of the greatest sages. He introduced the study of Indian literature into Persia, and thence also he imported the most noble of games, chess.</p>\n",

Here, however, he was met by the Roman general Constantius, who held him in check, while Chrestus, king of Cherson, at the instigation of Diocletian, invaded the kingdom of Bosporus, and actually made himself master of its capital city.

As a compensation for all this abuse, it may be observed that he enjoys, to this day, the highest reputation among the Jacobites of Syria and other parts of the East. He was born at Sozopolis, a town of Pisidia, in Asia Minor ; and was in early life a pleader at Berytus in Syria, being at that time a heathen. He is charged by his adversaries with having practised magic (Evagrius, <hi rend=\"ital\">H. E.</hi> 3.33; <hi rend=\"ital\">Epistola Orthodoxor. Episcop.

Having, however, embraced Christianity and been baptized in the church of St. Leontius, the Martyr, at Tripolis in Syria, he quitted the bar and devoted himself to a monastic life, in a monastery of Palestine, between Gaza and its port Maiuma. He appears to have embraced the Monophysite doctrine almost immediately after his conversion; for he is charged (<hi rend=\"ital\">Libellus Monachor. l.c.</hi>) with renouncing, before the days of his baptism were complete, the church into which he had been baptized; \" calling the holy temples of God receptacles of heresy and impiety \" (ibid.). It is probable, and indeed Theophanes distinctly asserts it (<hi rend=\"ital\">Chronog.</hi> p. 241, ed.

But as Agrippina had resolved to marry Octavia to her own son Domitius, afterwards the emperor Nero, it was necessary to put Silanus out of the way. It was easy to persuade the foolish emperor of any thing, and he therefore readily believed the charges brought against Silanus. Accordingly in <date when-custom=\"4\">A.

At the same time the marriage between him and Octavia was dissolved.

He lived at the close of that period of two centuries, during which lyric poetry advanced from the earliest musical improvements of Terpander, to that high stage of development which it attained in his own works, and in the odes of Pindar and the choruses of Aeschylus; in which the form could be no further improved without injuring the true spirit of poetry; and from which, after a brief rest at the point of perfection in the choruses of Sophocles, it rapidly degenerated in the hands of Euripides and of the Athenian dithyrambic poets, whom Aristophanes so severely satirized. His genius must have received, also, no small impulse from the political circumstances of his age. When young, he formed a part of the brilliant literary circle which Hipparchus collected at his court. In advanced life, he enjoyed the personal friendship of Themistocles and Pausanias, and celebrated their exploits; and in his extreme old age, he found an honoured retreat at the court of Syracuse.

On the death of his father, Nicomedes II., he was persuaded, contrary it is said to his own wishes, by Mithridates the Great, to assert his claim to the throne in opposition to his elder brother, and with the assistance of an army furnished him by the king of Pontus, easily expelled Nicomedes, and made himself master of Bithynia. Nicomedes, however, now had recourse to the senate of Rome; which pronounced in his favour, declared war against Socrates, and reinstated the elder brother on the throne. Socrates fled for refuge to the court of Mithridates, but that monarch was not yet prepared to brave the Roman power, and consequently found it convenient to sacrifice his unfortunate ally, and not only refused to support Socrates, but even put him to death.

It is related that Sostratus, not being allowed by Ptolemy to inscribe his own name upon his work, resorted to the artifice of secretly carving his name in deep letters in a stone of the building, which he then covered with a softer material, on which he inscribed the name of the king.

Notwithstanding the disparity of their ages, she appears to have lived in perfect harmony with the old king for some years, and had already borne him one child, when it was discovered that her step-son Antiochus was deeply enamoured of her, and Seleucus, in order to save the life of his son, which was endangered by the violence of his passion, gave up Stratonice in marriage to the young prince, whom he at the same time constituted king of the provinces of Upper Asia.

Antiochus II., surnamed Theos; 2. Apama, married to Magas, king of Cyrene; and 3. Stratonice [No. 4.]. The city of Stratoniceia in Caria was named after her, but whether it was founded in her honour by Seleucus or by Antiochus, is uncertain.

Here she in vain incited her nephew Seleucus II. to avenge the insult offered her by declaring war against the Macedonian king. According to another account, she was in hopes to induce Seleucus himself to marry her; but that monarch was wholly occupied with the recovery of Babylonia and the upper provinces of the empire. While he was thus engaged, Stratonice took advantage of his absence to raise a revolt against him at Antioch; but she was easily expelled from that city on the return of Seleucus, and took refuge in Seleucia, where she was besieged, taken prisoner, and put to death.

He was grown up in the lifetime of his uncle, from whom he received as presents several estates of those who had been proscribed. In the consular comitia of <date when-custom=\"-66\">B. C. 66</date> he was elected consul along with P. Autronius Paetus, but neither he nor his colleague entered upon the office, as they were accused of bribery by L. Torquatus the younger, and were condemned. L. Cotta and L. Torquatus, the father of their accuser, received the consulship in their stead. It was currently believed that Sulla was privy to both of Catiline's conspiracies, and he was accordingly accused of this crime by his former accuser, L. Torquatus, and by C. Cornelius. He was defended by Hortensius and Cicero, and the speech of the latter on his behalf is still extant. He was acquitted; but, independent of the testimony of Sallust (<hi rend=\"ital\">Cat. 17</hi>), his guilt may almost be inferred from the embarrassment of his advocate. According to A. Gellius ( <bibl n=\"Gel. 12.12\">12.12</bibl>) Cicero had borrowed a sum of money from Sulla for the purchase of his house on the Palatine. Cicero afterwards quarrelled with Sulla, because the latter had taken part in the proceedings of Clodius against him during his banishment. (<bibl n=\"Cic. Att. 4.3\">Cic. Att. 4.3</bibl>.) In the civil war Sulla espoused Caesar's cause. He served under him as legate in Greece, and commanded along with Caesar himself the right wing at the battle of Pharsalia, <date when-custom=\"-48\">B. C. 48</date>. In the following year he was ordered by Caesar to carry over from Italy to Sicily the legions which were destined for the African war; but the soldiers of the twelfth legion rose in mutiny, and drove him away with a shower of stones, demanding to receive, before they quitted Italy, the rewards which they had been promised in Greece. At the conclusion of the civil war Sulla purchased at a small sum some of the confiscated estates of the Pompeian party, and appears in consequence to have incurred no small degree of obloquy. He died during a journey in <date when-custom=\"-45\">B. C. 45</date>; and, according to Cicero (<bibl n=\"Cic. Fam. 9.10\">Cic. Fam. 9.10</bibl>, <bibl n=\"Cic.

When Cyrus reached Tarsus, the Cilician capital, he found that Menon's soldiers had sacked the city, and that Syennesis had fled for refuge to a stronghold among the mountains. He was induced, however, by his wife Epyaxa to obey the summons of Cyrus, and to present himself before him at Tarsus. Here he received gifts of honour from the young prince, whom he supplied in his turn with a large sum of money and a considerable body of troops under the command of one of his sons. At the same time, however, he took care to send his other son to Artaxerxes, to represent this step as having been taken on compulsion, while his heart all the time was with the king. From the narrative of Xenophon it appears that Syennesis at this time, though really a vassal of Persia, affected the tone of an independent sovereign. (<bibl n=\"Xen. Hell. 3.1.1\">Xen.

F. A. N., the son of L. Manlius Capitolinus Imperiosus, dictator in <date when-custom=\"-363\">B. C. 363</date>, was a favourite hero of Roman story. He possessed the characteristic virtues of the old Romans, being a brave man, an obedient son, and a severe father; and he never allowed the feelings of nature or friendship to interfere with what he deemed his duty to his country. Manlius is said to have been dull of mind in his youth, and was brought up by his father in the closest retirement in the country. The tribune M. Pomponius availed himself of the latter circumstance, when he accused the elder Manlius in <date when-custom=\"-362\">B. C. 362</date>, on account of the cruelties he had practised in his dictatorship in the preceding year, to excite an odium against him, by representing him at the same time as a cruel and tyrannical father. As soon as the younger Manlius heard of this, he hurried to Rome, obtained admission to Pomponius early in the morning, and compelled the tribune, by threatening him with instant death if he did not take the oath, to swear that he would drop the accusation against his father. Although the elder Manlius was no favourite with the people, and had received the surname Imperiosus on account of his haughtiness, yet they were so delighted with the filial affection of the younger Manlius, that they not only forgave his violence to the tribune but elected him one of the tribunes of the soldiers in the course of the same year. In the following year, <date when-custom=\"-361\">B. C. 361</date>, according to Livy, though other accounts give different years, Manlius served under the dictator T. Quintius Pennus in the war against the Gauls, and in this campaign earned immortal glory by slaying in single combat a gigantic Gaul, who had stepped out of the ranks and challenged a Roman to fight him. From the dead body of the barbarian he took the chain (<hi rend=\"ital\">torques</hi>) which had adorned him, and placed it around his own neck ; his comrades in their rude songs gave him the surname of Torquatus, which he continued ever afterwards to bear, and which he handed down to his descendants.

Cornelius Sulla and P. Autronius Paetus, who had been already elected consuls. It is stated by Dio Cassius (36.27) that Cotta and his colleague accused the consuls elect; but it appears from Cicero (<hi rend=\"ital\">de Fin.</hi> 2.19, <hi rend=\"ital\">pro Sull. 17, 18</hi>) that this is a mistake, and that it was the younger Torquatus [No. 15] who brought the accusation against Sulla and Paetus. Before Torquatus and Cotta entered upon the consulship, the first Catilinarian conspiracy, as it is called, was formed, in which Sulla and Paetus are said to have united with Catiline for the purpose of assassinating the consuls on the 1st of January. This conspiracy, however, failed. At this time and during his consulship Torquatus was in close connection with Hortensius, and he did not consult Cicero on any matters, although the latter was then praetor, and was very intimate with the younger Torquatus. (Cic. <hi rend=\"ital\">pro Sull. 4.</hi>) Notwithstanding this attempt upon his life, Torquatus defended Catiline in the course of the same year when he was accused of extortion (<hi rend=\"ital\">de repetundis</hi>) in his province. After his consulship Torquatus obtained the province of Macedonia, where he performed some exploits; in consequence of which the senate, upon the motion of Cicero, conferred upon him the title of imperator. During Cicero's consulship, <date when-custom=\"-63\">B. C. 63</date>, he took an active part in suppressing the Catilinarian conspiracy, although he was then out of health. He also supported Cicero, when he was banished in <date when-custom=\"-58\">B. C. 58</date>, and interceded in vain on his behalf with the consul Piso. He is not mentioned again, and probably died soon afterwards.

He maintains that the election of the consuls was then transferred from the Comitia Centuriata to the Comitia Curiata, and that the choice of the latter assembly was only ratified by the former. He further supposes that a compromise took place three years afterwards, <date when-custom=\"-482\">B.

Lucius, the father was a consummate flatterer, and by his arts he gained promotion. He set the example of adoring Caesar Caligula as a god, but this was done mainly to save his life. After being consul in <date when-custom=\"34\">A. D. 34</date>, he had been appointed governor of Syria, and he had induced Artabanus, the king of the Parthians, not only to come to a conference with him, but also to make his obeisance to the signa of the legions, which were apparently marked with the Roman emperor's effigy, or were accompanied by it. (Dio Cassius, 59.27.) Vitellius had got favourable terms of peace from Artabanus. But all this only excited Caligula's jealousy, and he sent for Vitellius to put him to death. The governor saved himself by his abject humiliation and the gross flattery, which pleased and softened the savage tyrant. A story is told so extravagant as hardly to be credible, if anything were not credible of a madman like Caligula. The emperor on one occasion said that he had commerce with the moon, and asked Vitellius if he had ever seen their embraces. Vitellius, affecting profound veneration, with his eyes on the ground, and in a faint tremulous voice replied, \" To you gods alone, my master, is it permitted to see one another.\" Nobody ever beat this, and Vitellius reigned the king of flatterers. He paid the like attention to Claudius and to Messalina. He was rewarded by being twice consul with Claudius, and censor. He and Messalina are accused of being the chief cause of the death of Valerius Asiaticus. (Tacit. <hi rend=\"ital\">Annal.</hi> 11.1-3.) After the execution of Messalina, he artfully removed the difficulty which Claudius had about celebrating his marriage with his niece Agrippina. by making it appear that the Senate and the people wished for the marriage. The Senate carried their adulation and hypocrisy so far as to say that they would compel the emperor to the marriage, if he hesitated. (<bibl n=\"Tac. Ann. 12.5\">Tac. Ann. 12.5</bibl>, &amp;c.) When Claudius was celebrating the Secular Games, the compliment of this outrageous flatterer was, \" Saepe facias ;\" which is as much as to say, \" O king, live for ever.\" Vitellius, though one of the strong partizans of Agrippina, was accused (<date when-custom=\"52\">A. D. 52</date>) of majestas by Junius Lupus, a senator; but the accusation only ruined the accuser. (<bibl n=\"Tac. Ann. 12.42\">Tac. Ann. 12.42</bibl>.) Lucius died of paralysis soon after he was attacked. He saw his two sons by Sextilia consuls before he died, and indeed both of them were consuls in the same year, <date when-custom=\"48\">A.

Vitellius quitted Rome for the camp in the Apennines, Lucius was left to defend the city ; but on the news of Tarracina being occupied by the partizans of Vespasian, the emperor sent his brother Lucius with six cohorts and five hundred horse to put down the insurrection in Campania. Lucius took Tarracina (<bibl n=\"Tac. Hist. 3.76\">Tac. Hist. 3.76</bibl>, &amp;c.), and made a great slaughter. If he had marched to Rome after this success, he might have made a formidable resistance to the party of Vespasian, for Lucius was a man of great activity and energy. But the feeble conduct of the emperor at Rome soon brought the contest to an end. Lucius was on his march from Tarracina to Rome, when he surrendered to the party of Vespasian, and was taken to the city and put to death. (<bibl n=\"Tac. Hist. 4.2\">Tac.

In the last title but one, the <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">καὶ</foreign>, which is not in the text of Suidas, should evidently be inserted, for it cannot be supposed that <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Ὀρέστης</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Πυλάδης</foreign> were two distinct plays, any more than <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Κάστωρ</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang=\"grc\">Πολυδεύκης</foreign>.
